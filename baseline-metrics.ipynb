      "   Clips_April = 48 * (Number of clips per friend, not given)\n",

      "2. In May, Natalia sold half as many clips as she did in April. Since we don't know the exact number of clips Natalia sold to her friends in April, let's call this unknown quantity 'x':\n",
      "   Clips_April = x\n",
      "   Clips_May = (Clips_April) / 2\n",
      "   Clips_May = x/2\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Now we have the total amount of clips Natalia sold in both months:\n",

      "   Total_clips = x + (x/2)\n",

      "   Total_clips = Clips_April + Clips_May\n",
      "   48 = x + (x/2)\n",
      "   Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:\n",

      "   x = 96 / 3\n",
