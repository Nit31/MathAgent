      "3) Now, we have a mixture of 6.67 liters of orange drink and 9 liters of pineapple drink that contains a total of 15.67 liters of liquid. However, one liter of the orange drink was spilled, so we need to subtract it from the total:\n",
      "   15.67 - 1 = 14.67 liters of liquid remaining\n",

      "Consider a group of 10 students who are all in the same grade school. Each student has a unique number of friends. The following conditions apply:\n",
      "1) If a student makes more than 20 new friends, their total number of friends increases by 20.\n",
      "2) If a student makes less than or equal to 20 new friends, their total number of friends remains the same.\n",
      "3) Lily made 50 friends before she transferred schools.\n",
      "4) Amy made ____ friends after transferring schools.\n",
      "5) The total number of friends that both Lily and Amy have together is ____.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How many friends did Amy make after transferring schools?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "First, we need to determine the number of friends Amy had before she transferred schools. We know from condition 3 that Lily made 50 friends before she transferred schools. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, this means Amy must have had 70 friends before she transferred schools (50 + 20). \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we need to find out how many friends Amy has after transferring schools. From the problem statement, we know that if a student makes more than 20 new friends, their total number of friends increases by 20. Since Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, this means she must have had 90 friends (70 + 20) after transferring schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, to find out how many friends both Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends each student has. This gives us a total of 140 friends (50 + 90). \n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Amy made 70 friends after transferring schools. The total number of friends that both Lily and Amy have together is 140.\n",
